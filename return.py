# Takes an integer and prints out its square
# x = int(input("x: "))
# print(x * x)

# Defining a function
# Takes an input called n
# In Python, we need to define the function prior to calling it, otherwise we get an error
# It reads from top to bottom
# def square(n):
#  return n * n

# Using this function we can simplify the previous input method
# x = int(input("x: "))
# print(square(x))

# Solution:
# First defining the functions
def main():
  x = int(input("x: "))
  print(square(x))

def square(n):
  return n * need

# Then, calling the function
# main()   

# Convention:
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
